        <p>
            Corfael are large green feathered creatures resembling a cross between a 
            cat and a wyvern. They have two hind legs and two wings in the place of 
            forelegs, although the wings can also function as slightly cumbersome legs
            when Corfael are on the ground. Their tail ends in a tuft of feathers which
            can be used to aid in steering during flight. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All Corfael wear masks made of bone china; they are an aggressive species 
            and use it as protection during fights and hunts. They are quick to squabble
            with other members of their community, but these fights are generally low stakes
            and only intended to assert and reestablish dominance over each other. Corfael 
            keep a close eye on their territory and may react very aggressively if they 
            think someone is harming their home. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Corfael have two sexes and reproduce sexually. They also exhibit sexual 
            dimorphism, with males being slightly smaller than females and having a feathery
            ridge down their back. Corfael are intensely protective of their families and 
            mate for life, building up large communities of family members. While children
            may travel away from parents when mature, they will not travel far, and will 
            still see their parents as part of their close family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Corfael are native to coniferous mountains. Twice a year they migrate to a
            different mountain in search of a replenished food supply. Corfael hunt any 
            and all nonmagical animals, although they prefer larger game like moose.
