        <p>
            Moop are small deer-like creatures. They gained their name because they make "moop" noises
            of varying tones and intensities in order to communicate. Moop are extremely friendly 
            creatures with no known enemies or predators. It is thought that they 
            are so kind and innocent that no one wishes to hurt them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moop have short and thick reddish-brown fur, which is 
            waterproof and helps to keep them warm in the winter. They are native to temperate forests
            and grasslands, but can be found all over the world  due to their affinity for the 
            <a href="/Users/home/Documents/GitHub/mm/mm.html">Mysterious Men</a>, whose travels are not
            limited to any particular biome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moop reproduce sexually, although all Moop are hermaphrodites and posess the ability to 
            bear a child and inseminate a partner. Moop achieve their full size at around 8 months, 
            and leave their parents after a year. Moop are relatively ambivalent towards members of
            their own species, and only meet with partners to engage in intercourse. Despite their 
            friendly disinterest in members of their own species, Moop have an odd affinity for 
            Mysterious Men and will often join them on their travels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moop are very sturdy creatures. They do not get sick or injured easily, and they can carry
            up to 3 times their own body weight on their backs. They are not very fast, but 
            they are capable of walking extremely long distances and surviving on very little sleep.
