            <br>Mlorp</h1>
        <p>
            The Mlorp is an odd blob shaped creature with eyes that glow in the dark. It can 
            form itself into any shape that it pleases,
            although it finds it easiest to just stay blob shaped. Mlorps come in all shapes and sizes
            imaginable. They are also capable of eating anything that they can stretch their bodies
            around, and so are often considered the garbage collectors of the ecosystem (in a friendly
            positive way).

        <h1 id="whoodle" class="clear"><br>
            <img src="othergallery/whoodle.jpg" width=30% height=auto class="img rightalign">
            <br>Whoodle</h1>
            <p>
                The Whoodle is a small bird with a long beak and a tuft of feathers on the top 
                of its head. Its head and body are pink, and its beak, legs, and feather tuft 
                are yellow. The Whoodle is named for its whistling warble that sounds sort of 
                like it is saying "whoodle whoodle whoodle". Whoodles eat all kinds of bugs 
                and can form symbiotic relationships with larger creatures by picking the bugs
                out of their feathers or fur.

            <br>Ymb</h1>
            <p>
                The Ymb is a light orange cat-like creature that stands upright. It has very 
                large ears and practically no distinguishable neck. They are very shy creatures
                that live in the desert, only coming out during dawn and dusk. They are rarely
                seen due to their secretive nature.

            <br>Cooper</h1>
            <p>
                Cooper is your average house cat, except he wears a red bowtie and appears to
                be able to cross the borders of space and time. He comes and goes wherever and 
                whenever he pleases, and nobody really pays him much mind.
